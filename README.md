## 🧠 Naming & Domain Selection

Originally titled **AI Horizons**, the site evolved through iterative naming batches and AI-generated prompts. After refining lists for creativity and relevance, **aiforgerun.com** emerged as the final domain.

Domain selection was tested with target users, including a teen gamer and aspiring YouTuber, ensuring alignment with the core audience and future expansion goals.

## 🎨 Design Strategy

### UX Philosophy:
> “When you’re learning something new, the tool shouldn’t be harder than the lesson.”

This approach led to a layout built for intuitive flow, minimal visual noise, and strong accessibility.

### Layout Choices:
- Neon pink + purple palette for retro-gaming appeal
- Top-right logo for site identity
- Left-side navigation with hamburger collapse for mobile
- Page header → content header → preview image → copy block
- Footer includes:
  - Personal logo (bottom-right)
  - Contact links
  - Widget-based comment system
- Ad placement structured between content zones without interrupting the UX

## 🧩 Wireframing with Copilot: Rapid ROI

Instead of traditional wireframing tools, I used **Microsoft Copilot** to prompt custom wireframes. This decision:
- Cut wireframing time to 5 minutes
- Avoided paid design software
- Delivered mobile and desktop views aligned with brand structure

> “Wireframing with AI let me skip hours of manual labor and focus on content architecture—efficiency with creative control.”

## 🚀 Future Development Goals

- Add searchable galleries of AI-generated images, tracks, and stories
- Integrate contributor submissions and community curation
- Continue documenting build phases and iterations
- Expand PHP templates for new content types and interactive elements
